I learned about Github project boards, following user accounts, starring projects, and about forking. I understood what the concept of forking is and have used it before, 
but I didn't know that it was primarily for working on open source projects. I haven't worked on an open-source project on github before, but now that I know how you do it it 
is demystified.
